# Omnidea Documentation Repository

**Constitutional amendments, proposed federal legislation, and technical appendices supporting transformational civic blueprints.**

This repository houses the legal and documentary infrastructure for Omnidea's reform blueprints—rigorous, implementable frameworks for systemic change grounded in constitutional law, evidence-based policy, and the principle that dignity is non-negotiable.

## What's Here

### Amendments/
Proposed constitutional amendments with precise legal language, enforcement mechanisms, and ratification pathways. Each amendment is drafted to be self-executing in its core prohibitions while providing clear congressional authority for enforcement infrastructure.

### Legislation/
Federal legislative proposals implementing constitutional reforms and structural changes. Bills include findings, definitions, authority citations, funding mechanisms, enforcement provisions, and realistic implementation timelines.

### Appendices/
Technical appendices serving as authoritative citation backbones for Blueprint series. Each appendix compiles primary legal texts, Supreme Court decisions, federal data, peer-reviewed scholarship, and documentary sources—maintained as living documents updated as new data emerges.
