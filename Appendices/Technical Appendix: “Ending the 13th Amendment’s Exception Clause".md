## VI. State-Level Punishment Clause Reforms

_These substantiate claims about growing precedent for eliminating slavery exceptions and to inform the model federal amendment._

**1. States Removing Exception Clauses (as of 2024)**

As of November 2024, seven states have passed measures removing punishment-clause language from their state constitutions:

- **Colorado** (Amendment A, 2018) – First state to remove exception clause.
    
- **Nebraska** (Initiative 433, 2020) – Removed involuntary servitude exception.
    
- **Utah** (Constitutional Amendment C, 2020) – Eliminated slavery and involuntary servitude exceptions.
    
- **Oregon** (Measure 112, 2022) – Removed exception clause allowing slavery and involuntary servitude as punishment.
    
- **Tennessee** (Amendment 3, 2022) – Abolished slavery and involuntary servitude as punishment for crime.
    
- **Vermont** (Proposal 2, 2022) – Removed exception allowing slavery and involuntary servitude as punishment.
    
- **Nevada** (Question 4, 2024) – Most recent state to remove exception clause.
    
- **Alabama** (Amendment 4, 2022) – **Contested status.** While voters approved language changes, legal analyses conclude that operative text may still permit involuntary servitude for criminal punishment. Should be treated as ambiguous rather than a completed removal.
    

**Supplementary summary:**

- AP: “Slavery, involuntary servitude rejected by 4 states’ voters” (Nov. 9, 2022).
    

**Note on Alabama:** The 2022 constitutional revision is contested among legal scholars and advocates. Some analyses argue that the operative language continues to permit involuntary servitude as punishment for crime, despite voter intent to remove it. When citing state counts in the Blueprint, Alabama should be noted separately as “contested” rather than counted cleanly in the abolition column.

**2. Ongoing & Recent Efforts (2023–2025)**

- Track via:
    
    - State legislative portals,
        
    - Ballotpedia entries for “state constitutions” + “involuntary servitude” amendments,
        
    - ABC/other major outlets summarizing 2024 and onward ballots.
        

**3. Analytical Scholarship on State Reforms**

- Bamieh, “The New Abolition” (Section 2.3)

## VII. Doctrinal & Structural Analysis for Enforcement Architecture

_These support a reading of the amended text that empowers Congress to regulate coerced labor, discriminatory punishment, and exploitative carceral economies as “badges and incidents” of slavery._

**1. Thirteenth Amendment Enforcement & Badges/Incidents**

- Classic and contemporary analyses (e.g., Alexander Tsesis and others) accessible via law review databases.
    
- James Gray Pope (NYU L Rev piece, above) on original understanding and modern reach.
    

**2. Climate, Labor, and Carceralism as Emerging Contexts**

**3. New Textualism & the Thirteenth Amendment**
