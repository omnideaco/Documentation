## TITLE I—FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

### SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Economic insecurity, lack of access to basic necessities, and inadequate social safety nets are primary drivers of behaviors that result in criminal justice system involvement.

(2) Research demonstrates a direct correlation between cuts to social safety net programs and increases in property crime, drug offenses, and incarceration rates.

(3) The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with over 1.9 million individuals in prisons and jails, at an annual cost exceeding $80 billion.

(4) A substantial proportion of incarcerated individuals were experiencing homelessness, food insecurity, untreated mental illness, or substance use disorders at the time of their offense.

(5) Providing access to food, housing, healthcare, and economic opportunity is significantly more cost-effective than incarceration, with prevention costs averaging $5,000-$15,000 per person annually compared to incarceration costs of $30,000-$60,000 per person annually.

(6) The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) serves as a critical buffer against food insecurity but reaches only an estimated 82 percent of eligible individuals, leaving millions without adequate nutrition.

(7) Over 650,000 individuals experienced homelessness on any given night as of the 2023 HUD Annual Homeless Assessment Report, and subsequent data indicate further increases. Lack of stable housing is a predictor of criminal justice involvement, chronic health conditions, and premature mortality.

(8) Mental health conditions and substance use disorders affect an estimated 64 percent of jail inmates and 54 percent of state prisoners, yet access to adequate treatment remains severely limited both in the community and in correctional settings.

(9) Formerly incarcerated individuals face unemployment rates exceeding 27 percent—higher than the unemployment rate during the Great Depression—due to employer discrimination, occupational licensing barriers, and lack of job training opportunities.

(10) Congress possesses authority under the General Welfare Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) and the Spending Clause to appropriate funds for programs that promote the general welfare, reduce poverty, and prevent criminal justice system involvement.

(11) Strengthening social safety nets is both a moral imperative and a practical strategy for reducing mass incarceration, improving public health outcomes, and advancing economic stability.

### SEC. 102. PURPOSES.

The purposes of this Act are—

(1) to establish food security as a fundamental component of public safety by ensuring all individuals have access to adequate nutrition;

(2) to recognize housing as a human right and create federal mechanisms to ensure emergency shelter, transitional housing, and permanent supportive housing are available to all who need them;

(3) to expand access to mental health and addiction treatment services, particularly for individuals at risk of criminal justice involvement;

(4) to create economic opportunity pathways for individuals with criminal records, reducing recidivism through employment and entrepreneurship support;

(5) to shift federal investment from punitive incarceration toward preventive social infrastructure that addresses root causes of criminalized behavior;

(6) to reduce the fiscal burden of mass incarceration on federal, state, and local governments by investing in upstream interventions that prevent justice system involvement; and

(7) to establish coordinated, evidence-based approaches to survival security that prioritize dignity, public health, and long-term stability over short-term enforcement.
