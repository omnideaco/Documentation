## TITLE I—FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

### SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Approximately 600,000 individuals are released from state and federal prisons annually, and over 10 million individuals cycle through local jails each year.

(2) Within 5 years of release, approximately 68 percent of individuals released from state prisons are rearrested, and 44 percent return to incarceration, indicating systemic failures in rehabilitation and reintegration.

(3) High recidivism rates are not attributable to individual failure but to structural barriers, including:
   - (A) inadequate programming and education in detention facilities;
   - (B) release to homelessness or unstable housing;
   - (C) employment discrimination based on criminal records;
   - (D) loss of healthcare coverage, including mental health and addiction treatment;
   - (E) family separation and breakdown of community ties;
   - (F) loss of occupational licenses and professional credentials;
   - (G) legal barriers to housing, employment, and public benefits; and
   - (H) inadequate reentry planning and support services.

(4) Research demonstrates that access to education, vocational training, mental health treatment, substance use treatment, and reentry services significantly reduces recidivism and improves public safety outcomes.

(5) Individuals who participate in correctional education programs are 43 percent less likely to return to incarceration than those who do not participate.

(6) Individuals who receive medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder while incarcerated and continue treatment upon release are 60 percent less likely to overdose and significantly less likely to return to criminal behavior.

(7) Access to stable housing within the first 30 days of release reduces recidivism by up to 20 percent and is a foundational requirement for successful reintegration.

(8) Employment is a critical protective factor against recidivism, yet approximately 75 percent of formerly incarcerated individuals remain unemployed one year after release due to discrimination, legal barriers, and lack of support.

(9) The current correctional system prioritizes punishment and containment over rehabilitation, resulting in facilities that warehouse individuals without providing meaningful opportunities for personal transformation or skill development.

(10) Federal, state, and local governments spend approximately $80 billion annually on incarceration, yet invest minimally in rehabilitation programs, reentry services, and alternatives to incarceration, despite evidence that such investments are more cost-effective and improve public safety.

(11) The 13th Amendment's exception clause—"except as punishment for crime"—has enabled exploitation of incarcerated individuals through forced labor rather than voluntary, fairly compensated work programs that build genuine skills.

(12) Congress has authority under the General Welfare Clause and Spending Clause to appropriate funds for rehabilitation and reentry programs that reduce recidivism and promote successful reintegration.

(13) Investing in rehabilitation and reintegration serves both public safety and human dignity, treating incarceration as a temporary intervention with pathways to restoration rather than permanent exclusion from society.

### SEC. 102. PURPOSES.

The purposes of this Act are—

(1) to establish comprehensive rehabilitation programs in detention facilities that provide education, vocational training, mental health treatment, substance use treatment, and life skills development;

(2) to ensure that all individuals in detention facilities receive thorough reentry planning beginning at admission and continuing through release;

(3) to guarantee that no individual is released from incarceration to homelessness by establishing federal support for transitional housing, rapid rehousing, and permanent supportive housing;

(4) to eliminate employment discrimination against formerly incarcerated individuals through fair chance hiring incentives, occupational licensing reform, and record sealing pathways;

(5) to ensure continuity of healthcare, including mental health and substance use treatment, from detention through community reintegration;

(6) to support family reunification and community reintegration through peer support, mentorship, and case management services;

(7) to expand alternatives to incarceration, including diversion programs, problem-solving courts, and community-based supervision;

(8) to establish evidence-based standards for rehabilitation and reentry programs with rigorous evaluation and accountability mechanisms;

(9) to redirect resources from incarceration toward rehabilitation, treatment, and support services that reduce recidivism and improve public safety; and

(10) to treat individuals involved in the criminal justice system with dignity, recognizing their capacity for growth, transformation, and full participation in society.

   - (4) successful reintegration serves the interests of individuals, families, communities, and public safety;

### SEC. 1106. DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE TO TITLE XI.

For purposes of this Title, the terms used have the meanings set forth in Section 201 (Definitions), which are incorporated herein by reference.

## CONCLUSION

This Act represents a comprehensive transformation of the criminal justice system's approach to incarceration and reentry. By investing in rehabilitation inside facilities, ensuring continuity of care and support upon release, removing barriers to successful reintegration, and expanding alternatives to incarceration, we can reduce recidivism, strengthen families and communities, and honor the dignity and potential of every person.

The choice is clear: we can continue a system that warehouses people and returns them to communities without support, perpetuating cycles of recidivism, or we can build a system that invests in rehabilitation and reentry, giving people real opportunities to succeed. This Act chooses the latter.

As Martin Luther King Jr. said, "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice." This Act bends that arc—toward rehabilitation over punishment, toward opportunity over exclusion, toward healing over harm, toward hope over despair. It recognizes that we are all more than the worst thing we have ever done, and that everyone deserves a genuine second chance.
