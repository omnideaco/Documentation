## TITLE I—FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

### SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) As of 2024, on the order of 8 percent of incarcerated individuals in the United States are held in privately operated facilities under contracts with federal, state, or local governments, representing over 150,000 individuals.

(2) Private prison corporations, including CoreCivic, Inc. and The GEO Group, Inc., operate facilities for profit, creating financial incentives to maximize occupancy and minimize operational costs.

(3) Some contracts between governmental entities and private prison corporations include "occupancy guarantees" or "bed guarantees" that require governments to maintain minimum incarceration levels or pay penalties, creating perverse incentives for mass incarceration.

(4) Research demonstrates that privately operated detention facilities have higher rates of violence, inadequate healthcare, insufficient staffing, and substandard conditions compared to publicly operated facilities.

(5) The profit motive inherent in for-profit detention is fundamentally incompatible with the goals of public safety, rehabilitation, and respect for human dignity.

(6) Private prison corporations have engaged in extensive lobbying efforts to promote policies that increase incarceration rates, including opposition to sentencing reform, support for harsh immigration enforcement, and resistance to decriminalization efforts.

(7) Workers in privately operated facilities, including both employees and incarcerated individuals performing work assignments, often face exploitative conditions, inadequate safety protections, and substandard compensation.

(8) The 13th Amendment's exception clause—"except as punishment for crime"—has enabled the use of forced labor in detention facilities, and private corporations have profited from such labor through contracts with governmental entities.

(9) Federal funding flows to state and local correctional systems through multiple grant programs, including the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program and the Community Oriented Policing Services program, providing Congress with authority under the Spending Clause to condition such funding on compliance with federal standards.

(10) Congress possesses authority under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) to regulate private prison corporations as interstate businesses engaged in commerce.

(11) Ending for-profit detention and redirecting resources toward rehabilitation, reentry services, and alternatives to incarceration serves the public interest, reduces recidivism, improves public safety, and respects human dignity.

### SEC. 102. PURPOSES.

The purposes of this Act are—

(1) to eliminate the profit motive from the operation of detention facilities by prohibiting new contracts with private prison corporations and phasing out existing contracts;

(2) to establish minimum federal standards for conditions of confinement in all detention facilities, whether publicly or privately operated;

(3) to prohibit contractual provisions that create financial incentives for mass incarceration, including occupancy guarantees and performance metrics based on facility population;

(4) to ensure that work programs in detention facilities are voluntary, fairly compensated, and conducted under safe conditions with appropriate labor protections;

(5) to provide support for communities economically dependent on correctional facilities to transition to alternative economic development strategies;

(6) to redirect resources currently expended on for-profit detention toward evidence-based rehabilitation programs, reentry services, and alternatives to incarceration; and

(7) to establish robust oversight, transparency, and enforcement mechanisms to ensure accountability in the operation of all detention facilities.

(b) **STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES.—** Provisions of this Act that impose obligations on State, territorial, tribal, or local government entities, including requirements regarding contracts with private prison corporations, detention facility standards, and labor protections, apply only as conditions on the receipt of federal funds under covered programs, consistent with Congress's authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1). State and local participation in covered programs is voluntary, and jurisdictions may decline federal funds and the conditions attached to them.

(c) **PRIVATE ENTITIES IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE.—** Provisions of this Act that regulate private prison corporations and detention service providers apply under Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3), as such entities:

   - (1) prohibit reasonable work assignments for facility maintenance, operations, or institutional support when such work is voluntary, compensated, and meets safety standards;
   - (2) prevent corrections agencies from imposing disciplinary sanctions for serious misconduct, violence, or threats to safety when such sanctions are proportionate and consistent with due process;
   - (3) require release of individuals before completion of judicially imposed sentences, except where authorized by earned time or good conduct provisions;

   - (5) create liability for every workplace injury in detention facilities, but rather to require compliance with occupational safety standards and workers' compensation coverage; or
