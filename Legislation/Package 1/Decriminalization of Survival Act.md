## TITLE I—FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

### SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The United States is experiencing a crisis of homelessness, with over 650,000 individuals experiencing homelessness on any given night as of the 2023 HUD Annual Homeless Assessment Report, and subsequent data indicate further increases.

(2) The criminalization of homelessness—through laws prohibiting sleeping, sitting, loitering, camping, or vehicle habitation in public spaces—does not address the root causes of homelessness and often exacerbates the conditions that lead to homelessness.

(3) In *City of Grants Pass v. Johnson*, 603 U.S. ___ (2024), the Supreme Court held that municipalities may enforce certain public camping bans without violating the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, even when individuals have no access to shelter.

(4) While *Grants Pass* clarified that such ordinances are not per se unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment, the decision does not address whether such laws are wise policy, humane, cost-effective, or consistent with equal protection principles.

(5) The criminalization of survival behaviors imposes substantial costs on municipalities, including the costs of law enforcement, prosecution, incarceration, and emergency services, which frequently exceed the cost of providing shelter and supportive services.

(6) Research demonstrates that enforcement-first approaches to homelessness result in increased emergency room visits, increased criminal justice system involvement, and decreased likelihood of accessing housing and services.

(7) Discriminatory enforcement of laws criminalizing homelessness disproportionately impacts racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities, and veterans, raising serious concerns under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(8) Congress possesses authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1), the Property Clause (Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2), and the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Section 5) to establish minimum standards for the enforcement of laws affecting individuals experiencing homelessness and to prohibit discriminatory application of such laws.

(9) Federal financial assistance for community development, public safety, and homelessness services provides substantial support to state and local governments, and Congress may condition such assistance on compliance with federal policy goals that advance the general welfare.

(10) Federal property is subject to exclusive or concurrent federal jurisdiction, and Congress may establish rules governing conduct on such property that preempt conflicting state or local laws.

### SEC. 102. PURPOSES.

The purposes of this Act are—

(1) to establish minimum standards for the humane enforcement of laws affecting individuals experiencing homelessness, consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in *City of Grants Pass v. Johnson*;

(2) to prevent discriminatory enforcement of such laws in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment;

(3) to reduce the fiscal and social costs associated with criminalizing survival behaviors by incentivizing provision of adequate shelter and services prior to enforcement;

(4) to create federal sanctuary spaces on federal property where individuals experiencing homelessness may legally exist without fear of criminal sanction for survival behaviors;

(5) to promote evidence-based, housing-first approaches to homelessness that prioritize dignity, public health, and cost-effectiveness over punitive enforcement; and

(6) to ensure that federal funds are not used to perpetuate policies that criminalize poverty and homelessness in the absence of adequate alternatives.

   - (E) the Continuum of Care (CoC) program under subtitle C of title IV of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11381 et seq.).

(3) **FEDERAL PROPERTY.—** The term "federal property" means any land, building, facility, or other real property—
   - (A) owned by the United States;
   - (B) leased by the United States; or
   - (C) under the administrative jurisdiction of any federal agency.

(4) **HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL.—** The term "homeless individual" has the meaning given the term "homeless" in section 103 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11302).

(5) **SHELTER BED.—** The term "shelter bed" means a bed in an emergency shelter, transitional housing facility, or other temporary housing facility that—
   - (A) is available to individuals experiencing homelessness at no cost or at a cost the individual can reasonably afford;

   - (C) does not impose conditions that exclude individuals based on protected characteristics under federal civil rights law; and
   - (D) does not require participation in religious activities as a condition of access.

(6) **SURVIVAL BEHAVIOR.—** The term "survival behavior" means conduct undertaken by a homeless individual to meet basic human needs, including—
   - (A) sleeping, resting, or lying down in public space;
   - (B) sheltering oneself from the elements using temporary structures or materials;
   - (C) sitting or remaining in public space;
   - (D) storing personal belongings in public space;
   - (E) residing in a vehicle; or
   - (F) asking for assistance, donations, or alms.

(7) **SURVIVAL CRIMINALIZATION LAW.—** The term "survival criminalization law" means any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or policy that prohibits, restricts, or penalizes survival behaviors.

### SEC. 202. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY.

(a) **FEDERAL JURISDICTION.—** Provisions of this Act that impose obligations on federal agencies, including the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Attorney General, and the Administrator of General Services, or that regulate conduct on federal property, apply directly under Congress's authority to legislate for federal agencies and federal property under Article I and Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 of the Constitution (the Property Clause).

(b) **STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES.—** Provisions of this Act that impose obligations on State, territorial, tribal, or local government entities, including requirements regarding survival criminalization laws and shelter availability, apply only as conditions on the receipt of federal funds under covered programs (including Community Development Block Grants, Justice Assistance Grants, COPS grants, Emergency Solutions Grants, and Continuum of Care grants), consistent with Congress's authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1). State and local participation in covered programs is voluntary, and jurisdictions may decline federal funds and the conditions attached to them.

(c) **CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTIONS.—** Provisions of this Act that prohibit discriminatory enforcement of survival criminalization laws and provide remedies for civil rights violations are enacted pursuant to Congress's authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce the guarantees of due process and equal protection against state action, where enforcement of such laws:
   - (1) has been shown through documented evidence to disproportionately target individuals based on race, ethnicity, disability, or other protected characteristics; and
   - (2) violates substantive due process by punishing individuals for involuntary status or conduct that is inseparable from that status when no lawful alternative exists.

(d) **LIMITATIONS ON SCOPE.—** Nothing in this Act shall be construed to:
   - (1) prohibit enforcement of laws against violence, threats, harassment, property damage, trespass on private property, obstruction of public rights-of-way, or other conduct that poses genuine public safety risks when applied in a non-discriminatory manner;
   - (2) require states or localities to permit survival behaviors in all public spaces without reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions;
   - (3) override state or local authority to regulate conduct on non-federal public property, except as a condition of receiving federal funds under covered programs; or
   - (4) create an absolute right to occupy any particular public space, but rather to ensure that criminalization does not occur when adequate shelter is unavailable.

(e) **CLARIFICATION OF VOLUNTARY CONDITIONS.—** Nothing in this Act shall be construed to commandeer state or local governments or require states to implement programs using state funds. All state and local obligations under this Act arise solely from voluntary acceptance of federal funds under covered programs and may be avoided by declining such funds.
