## TITLE I—GENERAL PROVISIONS

### SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Complete Abolition of Involuntary Servitude Act."

### SEC. 102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

(a) **FINDINGS.—** Congress finds that—
   - (1) the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, as revised, prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude in all circumstances, including as punishment for crime;
   
   - (2) for 160 years, the exception clause in the original Thirteenth Amendment permitted forced labor in correctional facilities, perpetuating systems of exploitation and racial injustice;
   
   - (3) ratification of the revised Thirteenth Amendment represents the completion of abolition begun in 1865;
   
   - (4) implementation of the revised Amendment requires clear definitions of prohibited conduct, enforceable labor standards, robust oversight mechanisms, and meaningful penalties for violations;
   
   - (5) incarcerated individuals retain fundamental human dignity and constitutional rights, including the right to refuse labor without retaliation;
   
   - (6) voluntary work programs in correctional facilities can support rehabilitation, skill development, and successful reintegration when offered with fair compensation, safe conditions, and genuine choice;
   
   - (7) federal enforcement authority is necessary to ensure uniform protection against involuntary servitude across all correctional facilities, including those operated by states, localities, and private entities;
   
   - (8) transparency and accountability are essential to prevent violations and ensure compliance with constitutional prohibitions on forced labor.

(b) **PURPOSES.—** The purposes of this Act are to—
   - (1) establish comprehensive definitions and standards implementing the revised Thirteenth Amendment;
   
   - (2) distinguish prohibited involuntary servitude from permitted voluntary labor and basic self-maintenance activities;
   
   - (3) create an independent federal oversight body with authority to inspect facilities, investigate complaints, and enforce labor protections;
   
   - (4) establish civil and criminal penalties sufficient to deter violations;
   
   - (5) provide transition support for correctional facilities moving from forced labor to voluntary, compensated work programs;
   
   - (6) ensure transparency through public reporting of facility compliance and violations;
   
   - (7) protect whistleblowers who report forced labor violations;
   
   - (8) coordinate federal, state, and local enforcement to eliminate involuntary servitude completely.
